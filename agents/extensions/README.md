# Extensions

Agent extensions managed by `dotfiles.sh`. Three types: **skills**, **MCP servers**, and **plugins**.

| Type | What it does | Managed by |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Skill | Injects domain knowledge via SKILL.md prompts | `SKILLS` table in `dotfiles.sh` |
| MCP server | Exposes external tools via Model Context Protocol | `MCP_SERVERS` table in `dotfiles.sh` |
| Plugin | Bundles commands, agents, hooks, and skills | `scripts/install-plugins.sh` + `claude plugin install` |

## Skills

Single source of truth: own skills live in `agents/extensions/skills/`; community/third-party skills are cloned to `~/.cache/skills-src/`. Both are symlinked into per-agent skill dirs:

- Claude → `~/.claude/skills/`
- Codex  → `~/.codex/skills/`
- Grok   → `~/.grok/skills/`

Each `SKILL.md` works across all three agents. Claude-specific frontmatter (`allowed-tools`, `user-invocable`, `effort`) is ignored by the others. Agent-specific variants (`relay`) use per-agent subdirectories.

Toggle manual skills with `./dotfiles.sh enable/disable <name>`; list status via `./dotfiles.sh skills`. Publish own skills to standalone GitHub repos via `./dotfiles.sh publish`.

### Skill matrix

Columns: **C**laude · Code**x** · **G**rok. Legend: ✓ auto-installed · ✱ manual (opt-in via `enable`) · — not wired to this agent.

> DeepSeek is reached **through** Claude Code via the `ds`/`dsx`/… aliases (see `shell/.functions`), so it inherits the Claude column directly.

> Note: SKILL.md supports an optional Claude-only `effort` frontmatter (`medium` / `high` / `max`) to set thinking budget per skill. Currently unset on every skill in this repo — they all inherit the session default.

### Vault-scoped (not in dotfiles)

These live in the Obsidian vault's `_claude/skills/` and are only loaded when working inside that vault:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [note-gen](https://github.com/chrisliu298/note-gen) | Generate Obsidian notes from source materials |
| [vault-linker](https://github.com/chrisliu298/vault-linker) | Build wikilink connections across vaults |
| obsidian-bases | Create and edit Obsidian Bases (`.base` files) |
| obsidian-cli | Interact with Obsidian vaults via the CLI |

### Project-local

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| publish-skill | Publish a local skill to a standalone public GitHub repo (lives in `.claude/skills/`, dotfiles-only) |

### Discovery quirks (not managed here)

- **Grok built-ins**: `~/.grok/skills/` also contains shipped extras (`best-of-n`, `check`, `create-skill`, `docx`, `help`, `pptx`, `xlsx`) that aren't from dotfiles.
- **Claude-fallback discovery**: Grok auto-discovers `~/.claude/skills/` as a lowest-priority source. Skills present there (e.g., `keep-warm`, `skill-creator`) remain visible to it even when not symlinked into `~/.grok/skills/` — they just won't auto-trigger unless the prompt strongly matches.
- **Plugin-provided skills**: Some skills (e.g., `lecture-refine`) come from Claude marketplace plugins and live in `~/.claude/skills/` as regular directories, not symlinks.
